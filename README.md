# Overview

{This is a Java program for a basic password manager. It allows the user to create a new account or manage existing accounts. The program reads and writes to a file named "accounts.txt" to store the account details.}

{My purpose for making this project is that I can learn more about Java and I can be familiar with this new language.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
